    <h1>The Golden Touch</h1>
   
    
<p>There once was a king named <strong>Midas</strong> who did a good deed for a <strong>Satyr</strong>. And he was then granted a wish by <strong>Dionysus</strong>, the god of wine.</p>

<p> His wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.</p>

 <blockquote><p>Excited about his <em>newly-earned powers</em> , Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.</p></blockquote> 

<p>But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.</p>

<p>Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”</p>

Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. <em>“The golden touch is no blessing,” </em> cried.
